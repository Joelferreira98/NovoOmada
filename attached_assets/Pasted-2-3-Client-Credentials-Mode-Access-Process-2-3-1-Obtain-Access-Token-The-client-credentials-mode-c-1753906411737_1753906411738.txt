2.3 Client Credentials Mode Access Process
2.3.1 Obtain Access Token
The client credentials mode can directly obtain the access token without the need to obtain the authorization code.

In the Query, fill in the grant type(the field name is grant_type). The grant type indicate the authentication method, and the client credentials code needs to be filled in with "client_credentials"
In the Body, fill in the msp id or customer id(The field name is omadacId), client ID(the field name is client_id) and client secret(the field name is client_secret).
An example of the curl command of the obtaining access token interface is as follows: Request:

curl "https://localhost:8043/openapi/authorize/token?grant_type=client_credentials" -H 'content-type:application/json' -d '{"omadacId": "de382a0e78f4deb681f3128c3e75dbd1", "client_id": "185586e0df424f5ea938de13cba91e01", "client_secret": "767372a5258a4fc1a03c57f3d071fc35"}' -X POST -i -k --insecure
Response:

{"errorCode":0,"msg":"Open API Get Access Token successfully.","result":{"accessToken":"AT-bjaJkIMIiekZY6NBufoQO4hdmJTswlwU","tokenType":"bearer","expiresIn":7200,"refreshToken":"RT-3ZjJgcORJSh76UCh7pj0rs5VRISIpagV"}}
Note: After obtaining the token, if you copy or import sites, or change application permission-related parameters (such as role/site/customer privilege) in the controller, the original token will become invalid and you need to authorize it again.

2.3.2 Access API Interface
This step is the same as the authorization code mode.

2.3.3 Refresh Access Token
This step is the same as the authorization code mode.

2.4 Batch Processing OpenAPIs
